# TREMOR12P

This module is a companion to the [TREMOR12](https://github.com/DigNeurosurgeon/TREMOR12) iPhone application that records 12 tremor parameters and exports them as a CSV file. This module contains of a iPython notebook file that performs automated data processing of the CSV file, including an example data set.

> The Watch version is in development and so is the processing code. Currently (Jan 10, 2016) only the accelerometer is available, unfortunately without timestamp.
